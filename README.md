# App Store Tilt

This repository tracks technical issues in the major mobile platforms (iOS and Android) which disadvantage third-party app stores relative to the first-party App Store/Play Store. We consider aspects like security, stability, performance, and functionality, and propose changes to create a more level playing field.

You can read the issues on the [dashboard](https://appfair.github.io/platform-tilt/), which is built from the content in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/appfair/appstore-tilt/issues).

<sub>This is part of [the App Fair Project](https://appfair.org). The repository is inspired by – but unaffiliated with – https://mozilla.github.io/platform-tilt/</sub>
